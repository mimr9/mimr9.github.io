Well, princess mononoke is a nostalgic animation that some of us saw in past . That happen in a normal life .

I don't know why I'm so thinking about this animation but I'm feeling that I'm living like ashitaka. Can you believe that? I'm not kiddig, this is my feel . I like japanese animations but most of it I like programming and specially one person in this kingdom: linus torvalds. I read linus torvald's book, "just for fun" .

The interesting common between a real programmer and ashitaka is that both of them are try for truth and never give up . That is why I'm feeling like ashitaka .
